# Backend For Dollar Luxury Project
Spring Boot, MongoDB, JWT

## Dependancies

 - Java 1.8
 - MongoDB
 - Maven

## Build

Project structure follows standard Maven Web App archetype. Clone, open with IDE and build using Maven/Pom.xml
Alternativley, navigate to root and run 

```
mvn clean install
```

## Front End

Note: I have another repository which acts as the front end/client for this project.
The other repo will be a vue-cli webpack project which builds static assets with `npm run build` in theory those assets can be 
placed into the resources directory of this repo and should gel reasonably well, but will take some extra work to get them working
together.
